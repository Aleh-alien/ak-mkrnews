  </p>
  <h3>Users of the Software Generally</h3>
  <p>
    “Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person. Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the Software Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type. Although such information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Software to help Company better understand how the Software is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Software to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Software users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Software.

LocalStorage is a key-value store database in the browser. We use cookies and localStorage on the Software to keep track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login name and password, to record your user preferences and saved collections, to keep you logged into the Software and to facilitate purchase procedures.
